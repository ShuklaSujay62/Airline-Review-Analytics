## Introduction

Air travel plays a significant role in modern transportation, and understanding customer feedback is crucial for improving airline services. This project analyzes a dataset containing airline ratings and reviews, aiming to derive meaningful insights into customer satisfaction.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize column names.
2. **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and summarize key statistics.
3. **Visualizations**: Create various plots to visualize the data, including:
   - Bar plots of average ratings by airline
   - Count plots of recommendations
   - KDE plots for rating distributions
   - Correlation heatmaps for numerical features
   - Pair plots for relationships between features
   - Facet grids for detailed comparisons

## Visualizations

Throughout the analysis, several visualizations were created to depict customer ratings and trends:
